# Hamgman_Game
How to Play?

This game is for 1-2 players.

In this game the program will choose a word randomly and the player will try to guess the word that was choosen.

At first the player will choose the difficulty of the word:

  1. word with at most 4 letters.
  2. word with at least 4 letters.

In each turn the player will try two guesses - one letter and one word.

If the player guesse wrong, the program will draw one element of the Hanged Man (each letter or a word consider as one guess).

If the player guess the right word before the program draw the complete sketch of the Hanged Man - the player will win!

If the player could not guess the word before the Hanged Man sketch was done - the player will lose.
